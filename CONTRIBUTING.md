# Contributing to FastJSONSerializer 🚀

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **FASTEST VBA JSON Converter**!

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Reports
Found a bug? Help us improve FastJSONSerializer!

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Include VBA code samples** that reproduce the issue
4. **Run benchmarks** if it's a performance-related bug

### 💡 Feature Requests
Have an idea to make FastJSONSerializer even faster?

1. **Use the feature request template**
2. **Describe the performance impact** of your proposed feature
3. **Include use case examples** showing how it would be used
4. **Consider backward compatibility** with existing code

### 🏆 Performance Improvements
FastJSONSerializer is all about **DESTROYING** the competition with speed!

**Performance Contribution Guidelines:**
- **Benchmark before and after** your changes
- **Target specific use cases**: Arrays, Strings, Objects, Parsing
- **Maintain compatibility** with existing API
- **Include test cases** for new optimizations
- **Document performance gains** in your pull request

**Current Performance Targets:**
- Arrays: Currently **80.8% faster** than VBA-JSON (can we hit 90%?)
- Strings: Currently **86.7-98% faster** than VBA-JSON (can we hit 99%?)
- Objects: Currently **38.7% faster** than VBA-JSON (can we hit 50%?)
- Parsing: Currently **100% faster** than VBA-JSON (maintain perfection!)

### 🧪 Testing
All contributions should include appropriate tests:

1. **Add test cases** to `TestFastJSONSerializer.bas`
2. **Run performance benchmarks** using `PerformanceBenchmark_TURBO.bas`
3. **Test against VBA-JSON** to ensure we maintain our performance lead
4. **Verify compatibility** across different Excel versions

### 📝 Code Style
Keep the codebase clean and performant:

- **Use meaningful variable names** (e.g., `turboTime`, `vbaTime`)
- **Include performance comments** explaining optimization techniques
- **Follow VBA naming conventions** (PascalCase for functions, camelCase for variables)
- **Add error handling** with informative debug messages
- **Document complex algorithms** with inline comments

### 🚀 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-optimization`
3. **Make your changes** with proper testing
4. **Run benchmarks** to verify performance improvements
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Create pull request** with detailed description
