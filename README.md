# FastJSONSerializer

FastJSONSerializer is a streamlined, no-nonsense VBA tool designed exclusively for serialization—converting your VBA data structures (like arrays, dictionaries, etc.) into JSON format. It’s built to get the job done fast without any extra baggage. Unlike a parser that reads JSON back into VBA, this tool does one thing and does it well: it turns your data into a JSON string that you can easily push to APIs, store in databases, or use anywhere JSON is needed.

Inspired by the fast performance of Json2VBA (which handles parsing), FastJSONSerializer is its serializing-only counterpart. Simply import it into your VBA project and start generating JSON output quickly—no parsing, no fuss, just efficient, high-speed serialization.
